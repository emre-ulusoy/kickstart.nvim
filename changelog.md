# Changes

- `shifttabstop` and `shiftwidth` set to 4, as is the proper way to set the tab width apparently. 
  - [ ] in progress
  - Along with this, I had to manually set `noexpandtab`. This is to stop tabs from turning into spaces.

## Notes

- Occasionally take snapshots of the Lazy versions to be able to roll back to.
  - [ ] figure out how.
