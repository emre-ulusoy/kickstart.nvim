# Changes

- `softtabstop` and `shiftwidth` set to 4, as is the proper way to set the tab width apparently.
  - Along with this, I had to manually set `noexpandtab`. This is to stop tabs from turning into spaces.
  - [x] in progress. added to the custom options section but not working. also did `expandtab` = false instead of using `noexpandtab`
